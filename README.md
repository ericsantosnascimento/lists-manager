# Lists Manager API

My solution here was the simplest I built an Spring boot application to accomplish the requirements, everything exposed over rest API

to build it -> mvn clean package.

to run it ->  docker-compose build; docker-compose up two docker commands and you'll have the service running without issues
* ps docker compose it's necessary.

to check available endpoints in application refer to -> http://localhost:8080/sysapi/swagger-ui.html
